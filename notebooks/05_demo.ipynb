Duty is a legal obligation that requires one person to take reasonable care when engaging in any activity or behavior that affects the safety or health of another individual. Breach of duty occurs when a person fails to meet their duty to act with reasonable care. Causation establishes that the defendant's actions were the actual cause of the plaintiff's injuries.
